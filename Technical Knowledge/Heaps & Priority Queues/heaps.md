# Heaps and Priority Queues

## Introduction to Heaps

A **heap** is a type of tree data structure that satisfies the **heap invariant**: 
- For a **max heap**, the key of each node is greater than or equal to the keys of its children.
- For a **min heap**, the key of each node is less than or equal to the keys of its children.

### Characteristics
- **Complete binary tree**: All levels are fully filled except possibly for the last, which is filled from left to right.
- **In-place**: Heaps are generally implemented using arrays for efficient memory use.
